<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, my name is Evan Greis. I'm an avid model railroader and love tinkering and building. I've been in the model railroading hobby basically my entire life. My grandpa started me in this hobby after he started building his garden railway in 2002. When I was 7, my grandparents got me my first model train, a G scale Bachmann Big Hauler Starter Set. To give a bit of context, G scale is a track gauge (width) of 45 millimeters to accommodate a range of gauges, such as narrow gauge (1:20.3) representing real life 3ft narrow gauge trains or more commonly standard gauge (1:29 through 1:32) which is the gauge of most American rail networks. The proportions mean the model is a scale model of a real life model. So for instance, a 1:29th scale model is 1/29th the size of a real object. I mostly model in standard gauge, more specifically 1:29. <p>

<p> After I got that first starter set, I have been building my own collection. I usually go to train shows and find more models there. At Christmas of 2023, I got my first 3d printer. I had wanted one for a while because of all the cool things that can be done. Now I have completed a few projects that I am very proud of. Some parts of these projects can take up to 2 days to print. I try to get my models to be as accurate as possible, though that sometimes is not possible with a filament printer versus a resin printer. A filament printer takes a spool of plastic and makes a product out of that while a resin printer takes liquid resin and solidifies it with UV light. I started with a caboose, based on a WW2 Pullman Troop Sleeper car, which were used in WW2 to haul troops across the US. Now I am working on a baggage car for a recently finished project, which is a steam locomotive.</p>
